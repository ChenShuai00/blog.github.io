I am an associate professor at Anhui University([AHU](https://en.ahu.edu.cn/)). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Anhui University, China. As the lead or corresponding author, I have published over 20 papers in SCI/SSCI-indexed journals, including IEEE TFS, INFFUS, GDN, CAIE, ASOC, ELEC, EAAI, FODM, and IPM, among others. I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for several prestigious international journals, such as the Journal of Business Research, Annals of Operations Research, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. My research areas encompass data-driven decision analysis, decision theory and methods, and data mining.
